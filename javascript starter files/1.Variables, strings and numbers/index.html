<!-- data type is the type of data which we are using, 
we have different type like number(just a number either positive o negative)
,strings(just some plain text), all type of data can be stored inside Variables,console inside browser  -->
  <!-- var name ="chris";
  name -->
  <!-- a variable can be riassigned like this
  name = "ted"; 
  var age = 34;
  age
  what can we do once we have some variables?we can concatenate them like this
  var joined = "my name is" + name + and i am + age
  joined,we can add it before the closing section or in the head section-->
  
  <script>
    var name = "ted";
    name = "ted bundy";
    console.log(name);

    var age = 34;

    // if we need to use quotation inside string we need to use different type of quotations mark inside and outside
    var joined = "my name is" + name + "and i'm" + age;
    // or we can use \
    // 'It\'s six o\'clock.';
    // "Remember to say \"please\" and \"thank you.\"";
    
    console.log(joined);
  </script>
