    // the switch it's similiar to the else if ,but we can check as many conditions as we want,
    // inside the parentesis we put want we want to verify, then we can create as many case as we want,
    // we need to put a break to end the switch, we can run a code if either one of two more case is true by putting to case one after the other,
    //the defaultit's a fallback if there isn't a condition that is true, the switch end with the first condition that is true
